All this week our promo is going to work daily for one project, which is an Eventbrite-like.
The goal of this website will be to create events, and register to them.
It will starts with the back-end part, then a fonctionnate mailer to push to production.

Here is the program of the week :

Monday : before becoming views champion, we will create data bases. Then we will link a mailer in order to get an email system ready to push to production.

Tuesday : we will generate the users management with Devise (sessions, logins, inscription, etc), then start writting the first views of the website. Let's try to do in one day what we have done all last week for another project : The Gossip Project, HURRAY !!

Wednesday : we will make possible the registration to events and connect an API with payment system Stripe.

Thursday : time to add some front by using the Pipeline asset, and upload picture with Active Storage.

Friky-friday (thanks God) : let's create an admin interface where admin can do "admin" stuff, oulalala !
